* Region: Please use `us-west-2`, even if youâ€™re living closer to another available region.


## Instructions


* First, create the network by running the `create-stack.sh` file in the terminal, as shown below:

```./create-stack.sh UdagramNetwork Udagram-network.yml network-params.json```

* Then, create the Web servers by running the `create-stack.sh` file in the terminal, as shown below :

```./create-stack.sh UdagramServers Udagram-servers.yml servers-params.json```

* If you want to create The bastion host, run the `create-stack.sh`file in the terminal, as shown below. Make sure to update the bastion-params file with your own ***Key Pair name***
